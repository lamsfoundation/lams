LAMS provides teachers with an intuitive visual authoring environment for creating sequences of learning activities. These activities can include a range of individual tasks, small group work and whole class activities based on both content and collaboration.

Once a sequence is created, it can reuse in one or many courses. 

Additionally, LAMS provides a real-time followup and tracking monitoring interface where teachers can interact with students as they go thru the learning activities.
