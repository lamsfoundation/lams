	<!-- This file contains bean definitions that are application contexts. Currently there is single beanRefContext.xml file,
		 but there can be several of them in classpath. If so, they will be collected by locatorFactorySelector
		 and put together, creating one definition of beans.
		 Each bean takes a list of XML files as a constructor argument. These XML files are "real" application context files -
		 - they contain definitions of service, DAO etc. beans. Each bean in beanRefContext.xml is an application context
		 containing in result all beans from the listed XML files.
		 Each bean from this file is a singleton, meaning that these large application contexts are created only once,
		 at start up.
		 Beans from this file can be used as parent contexts for web applications like LAMS tools.
		 Each web application declaring the same parent context uses the same, shared beans. These shared beans are services used
		 by all web applications. Sharing application contexts allows avoiding replication of common services.
		 
		 In LAMS there is currently only one shared application context: "context.central". It contains all service and tool
		 beans definitions - virtually everything there is, except for some local beans like tools' DB update service
		 or admin beans.
		 All tools and core services use this bean as parent context.
		 Previously each tool created its own set of core services, which resulted in excess memory consumption.
		 Now all beans are only in one copy and shared among different parts of LAMS system.
		 
		 Beans in this file support inheritance, but in Spring 1.2.8 there is a bug(?) which prevents from accessing beans
		 in programatic way from inheriting application context beans - only beans from the top of bean hierarchy were accessible.
		 This forces usage of only one shared context bean.
		 
		 This entry:
		 <value>classpath*:org/lamsfoundation/lams/tool/**/*pplicationContext.xml</value>
		 collects all application context files from all deployed lams tools.

		 If new application context file is used in development and its beans need to be added to shared context,
		 just add it to the end (or wherever it is suitable) of the list.
