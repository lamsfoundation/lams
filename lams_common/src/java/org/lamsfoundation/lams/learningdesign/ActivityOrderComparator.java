/**
 * The activity order comparator used for sorted set. Order id is used as
 * the primary comparing criteria as it is unique within a complex activity.
 * If they are the same, activity id are used for comparison to ensure the
 * sorted set won't treat two activities with the same order id as the
 * same activity. If either of the activity ids are null (activities are not
 * yet saved in the database) use the activity ui id. The ui ids will compare
 * nulls if required, with null being lower than not null. Two nulls will equal true.
 *
 * Note: this comparator may impose orderings that are inconsistent with equals as it
 * compares order id before activity id. But in practise all sensible cases should
 * come out with the same ordering.
