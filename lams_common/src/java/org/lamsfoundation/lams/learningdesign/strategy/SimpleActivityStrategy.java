/**
 * Activity strategy that deals with the calculation for all simple activity
 * strategies. It is the abstraction of all sub-activity strategies. Template
 * method, where possible, should be created to avoid as much duplicate
 * code as possible. Abstract methods sit at this level is designed to be
 * overidden by sub simple activities to polymorphically achieve the behavior
 * specific to particular conrete activity.
 * <p>
 * When a particular strategy is created, the activity should be
 * stored in the strategy. This allows the strategy to have the
 * correct activity type and (hopefully) stops the need for casting,
 * which is difficult with Hibernates proxied objects. Each strategy
 * needs to define a method getActivity() so that shared methods
 * (such as getContributionType()) can access the activity.
