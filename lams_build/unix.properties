# Properties needed to build LAMS.
# These are OS dependent properties, configured for various flavours of *nix.
# Named unix.properties for convenience.
#
# Instead of changing properties here
# you can create a new file build.properties for just two of them.
# That file is added to .cvsignore, so you will not be asked to commit it.
# That file is imported just before current file
# and its entries will take precendence over ones here
# because entries defined later are ignored.
# If build.properties is missing or, in some projects, is not imported before ${osPropertiesName}.properties
# entries will be taken from current file.
