<p>
This content repository is designed to store single files and 
packages of files on disk in a relatively simple way. It is not a full 
blown repository as you would find behind a web development
package. 
</p>
<p>
Each entry in the repository is represented as a "node", which 
has a unique id or uuid. Each node belongs to a workspace, and
there may be many versions to the node. The files are stored on disk
and the information about the files is stored in the lams_cr_* tables
in the database.
</p>
<p>
A node may represent a single file (a file node) or be a package node. A 
package node has a set of child nodes which are file nodes. 
</p>
<UL>
<LI>To create a file node, you supply an input stream, the 
filename and mimeType (if known) to the repository. The file is stored 
and these details are all returned when the node is accessed. 
</LI>
<LI>To create
a package node, you put all the files in the package in a directory
in the file system, then supply the directory path and the name 
of the initial file in the package to the repository. When you
get the package node back, you can access the stream of the initial
file and then work from there.
</LI>
<LI>The repository also supports a data node, which is node
that has no child nodes and no file. There isn't any interface
that supports a child node but it can be added easily if desired.
</LI>
</UL>

<p>The repository keeps a set of properties for each node. At the moment,
these are read only to tools. An additional parameter
containing arbitrary nodes could easily be added to the repository
calls and this would allow the repository to store arbitrary properties
on behalf of tools.
</p>

<H2>Classes</H2>
<p>The classes of interest to tools are as follows. Apart from SimpleCredentials, tools should use the interfaces
and not the implemented classes to allow the implementation to be changed in the future.

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>ICredentials,SimpleCredentials</TD><TD>SimpleCredentials is an implementation of ICredentials. To log in, the 
tool will create a SimpleCredentials object.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>IRepositoryService</TD><TD>The interface used for access to the repository. This is the equivalent of a SLSB interface
to the repository. It is implemented by singleton SimpleRepository. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ITicket</TD><TD>The Ticket represents the "authorisation" key to the repository. When the tool logs in, it
will be passed a SimpleTicket object, which implements the ITicket interface. This ticket must be supplied
back to the repository to access the tool's nodes.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>IValue</TD><TD>An object that allows the value of a property to be used as a String, Long, Double, Boolean
or Calendar. At present, only Strings have been used so other types (particularly Calendar) may not
function correctly. Implemented by CrNodeVersionProperty (a Hibernate based data object).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>IVersionDetail</TD><TD>Describes the versions of a node. Useful for displaying a version history if the
user needs to select a particular version. Implemented by SimpleVersionDetail.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>IVersionedNode</TD><TD>The IVersionedNode interface represents a particular version of a node. When 
the tool asks for a file or package, it will be returned the node representing the files. This node
will allow the package to get not only the filestream but the original file name and mime type.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>NodeKey</TD><TD>The key to a node is made up of the UUID (Long) and a version (Long). This class
encapsulates both keys, and is used to return the keys when a node is created/updated.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>NodeType</TD><TD>Defines all the valid node types. Used for testing
whether something is a file node or a package node: e.g. isNodeType(NodeType.FILENODE).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>PropertyName</TD><TD>Defines all the current property names - such as MIMETYPE, FILENAME.
Used to get the appropriate property from a node. e.g. IValue value = node.getProperty(PropertyName.MIMETYPE).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>PropertyType</TD><TD>Defines what type a property really is - String, Long, Double, etc.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>Note:  All interfaces with Admin in their name are only to be used within the repository and must not be used by tools. </p>

<h2>Spring Context</h2>

<p>The context file for Spring is available as /org/lamsfoundation/lams/contentrepository/applicationContext.xml.</p>

<p>The only bean that should be accessed directly is the repository service. The
bean reference is "repositoryService".</p>

<p>The content repository uses the core datasource and the shared transaction manager
defined in /org/lamsfoundation/lams/applicationContext.xml.

<h2>Typical Usage</h2>

<P>
Sample usage of the repository can be seen in example webapp, built as lamscr.war. The struts classes
are in org.lamsfoundation.lams.contentrepository.struts (in the src hierarchy)
and the jsps are in the web hierarchy. The content repository is also used by the 
IMS Content Package Reader tool, so this may also be used as an example of accessing
the repository from a tool.
</P>

<p>The simplest way to access the content repository service is by setting up 
the service as an attribute of your own service bean. In your Spring context
file, add the following property to your bean:</p>

<pre>
	&lt;property name="repositoryService"&gt;&lt;ref bean="repositoryService"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
</pre>

<p>For example, the IMS Content Package Reader tool defines its main service as follows</p>

<pre>
	&lt;bean id="imscpService" class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean"&gt;
		&lt;property name="transactionManager"&gt;&lt;ref bean="transactionManager"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
		&lt;property name ="target"&gt;
			&lt;bean class="org.lamsfoundation.lams.tool.imscp.service.ImscpServicePOJO"&gt;
				&lt;property name="packageDAO"&gt;&lt;ref bean="packageDAO"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
				&lt;property name="repositoryService"&gt;&lt;ref bean="repositoryService"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
			&lt;/bean&gt;
		&lt;/property&gt;
		&lt;property name="transactionAttributes"&gt;
			.....
		&lt;/property&gt;
	&lt;/bean&gt; 
</pre>

<P>If you are not using Spring, then you can access the repository service object via the RepositoryProxy. 
This will set up a new Spring application context that the content repository will use.</P>

<P>When a tool is first run, it should identify itself to the repository and create a new workspace.
The "password" must be 6 or more characters.</P>
<PRE>
	private String repositoryWorkspaceName = "myworkspace";
	private String repositoryUser = "toolname";
	private char[] repositoryId = {'s','o','m','e','t','h','i','n','g','1'}; 

	private void configureContentRepository() {
		IRepositoryService repService = getRepositoryService();
		ICredentials cred = new SimpleCredentials(repositoryUser, repositoryId);
		try {
			repService.createCredentials(cred);
			repService.addWorkspace(cred,repositoryWorkspaceName);
		} catch (ItemExistsException ie) {
			log.warn("Tried to configure repository but it "
					+" appears to be already configured. Exception thrown by repository being ignored. ", ie);
		} catch (RepositoryCheckedException e) {
			String error = "Error occured while trying to configure repository."
				+" Unable to recover from error: "+e.getMessage();
			log.error(error, e);
			throw new Exception(error,e);
		}
	}
</PRE>

<P>Before accessing the repository, the tool will need to log in.
Once the tool has been given a ticket, it must use the same repository
object (ie a repository returned by the same context). If it gets a repository
from a different context, the ticket will not be recognised and access denied.
This is a shortcoming in the repository and needs to be fixed. 
</P>
<p>There is currently no timeout on a ticket (despite what the exception 
says) so the tool may keep it for months if it wants. But if the tool 
receives an access denied exception, then something has gone wrong and the 
ticket is no longer valid so the tool should log in again and get a new
ticket.</P>

<PRE>
	private ITicket getTicket( ) throws Exception {
		ICredentials cred = new SimpleCredentials(repositoryUser, repositoryId);
		try {
			try { 
				repositoryTicket = repositoryService.login(cred, repositoryWorkspaceName);
			} catch ( WorkspaceNotFoundException e ) {
				log.error("Content Repository workspace for blah tool not configured. Attempting to configure now.");
				configureContentRepository();
				repositoryTicket = repositoryService.login(cred, repositoryWorkspaceName);
			}
		} catch ( RepositoryCheckedException e ) {
			String error = "Unable to get repository service. Exception: "+e.getMessage();
			log.error(error,e);
			throw new Exception(error,e);
		}
		return repositoryTicket;
	}
</PRE>

<P>Using the ticket, the tool can now add, retrieve, delete and copy nodes. Deleting a package
node deletes all the files in the package. Warning: deleting 
removes the node completely - from both the database and the file system.</P>
<PRE>
		
	User uploads a file:
	NodeKey nodeKey1 = repositoryService.addFileItem(repositoryTicket, 
							fileInputStream, 
							filename, 
							fileMimeType, 
							"This is the initial version",
							user.getUserId());

	User uploads a new version of the file:
	NodeKey nodeKey2 = repositoryService.updateFileItem(repositoryTicket, 
							nodeKey1.getUuid(), 
							filename,
							fileInputStream, 
							fileMimeType, 
							"This is the updated version,
							user.getUserId());

	Get the second version of the file:
	IVersionedNode node = repositoryService.getFileItem(repositoryTicket, 
							nodeKey2.getUuid(), nodeKey2.getVersion());
	
	Copy the initial version of the file node. CopyNodeVersion copies the specified version or last version (if not specified), duplicates the actual files.
	NodeKey nodeKey3 = repositoryService.copyNodeVersion(repositoryTicket, 
							nodeKey1.getUuId(),
							nodeKey1.getVersion(),
							user.getUserId());

	Copy the latest version of the file node. 
	NodeKey nodeKey3 = repositoryService.copyNodeVersion(repositoryTicket, 
							nodeKey1.getUuId(),
							null,
							user.getUserId());

	Delete the second version of the file:
	String[] problemFiles = repositoryService.deleteVersion(repositoryTicket,nodeKey2.getUuid(), nodeKey2.getVersion());

	Delete all versions of the file:
	String[] problemFiles = repositoryService.deleteNode(repositoryTicket, nodeKey2.getUuid());
	
</PRE>

<p>Similar methods exist for packages of files. See IRepositoryService for all the available calls.</p>

<p>In theory, when the tool is complete, it should logout from the repository. This invalidates the ticket.
In practise, our tools are likely to never logout.</p>

<PRE>
	repository.logout(ticket);
</PRE>
<H2>Exceptions and Transactions</H2>

<P>There are two sorts of exceptions - RepositoryCheckedException and
RepositoryRuntimeException.</P>

<P>RepositoryRuntimeException may be thrown
by any call to the repository irrespective of whether it is defined
in the signature. It is used for internal errors, not errors caused
by bad input from a tool. The repository may also thrown other runtime
errors, such as the Spring runtime errors which wrap Hibernate errors.
</P>

<P>RepositoryCheckedException is the superclass to 10 detailed
checked exceptions. Most calls throw more than one detailed exception.
Calling code can catch either the detailed exceptions or just 
RepositoryCheckedException.</P>

<p>All the calls on IRepository should be transactional, defined
in the Spring context file.  Runtime exceptions will trigger the transaction 
to be marked for rollback. Checked exceptions will NOT trigger the transaction 
to be marked for rollback so it is up to the calling code to trigger a 
rollback if needed. This allows the calling code to handle the exception and 
continue the transaction.</p>

<p>However, all we can roll back are database changes. We cannot roll back
file system changes. For this reason, we try to do the database changes
first. But it isn't perfect. </p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Repository location</STRONG> Edit 
org.lamsfoundation.lams.contentrepository.contentRepositoryApplicationContext.xml 
(in the src hierarchy). Defaults to /tmp/repository. This can reside anywhere it 
can be accessed as a directory - it does not need to be under the JBOSS hierarchy.
<EM>This needs to be changed to pick up the value from the database!</EM></LI>
<LI><STRONG>Database user and password</STRONG> Edit build.properties (in the root of the project)
to set the JBOSS directory. This is required for the database related ANT tasks.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>JBOSS location</STRONG> Edit build.properties (in the root of the project)
to set the JBOSS directory. This is required for the deploy and copyfiles ANT tasks.
</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Building the Repository</h2>
<p>After configuring (see previous section) use the ANT Build script to build and deploy
the content repository code.
<UL>
<LI>
With the database running, run the <STRONG>rebuild-db</STRONG> and
<STRONG>insert-test-data</STRONG> from the lams_common build
file, and delete any old files in the content repository file directory.
</LI>
<LI>
At this point, you can run the JUNIT tests if desired. To run them, run 
the the <STRONG>test-report</STRONG> task in the build file, 
or run the org.lamsfoundation.lams.contentrepositoryAllTests junit test suite. This will
run all the current tests. Note: the NodeTransactionTest class is not
complete so it is not included in the test suite.
</LI>
<LI>
The first time you compile, you will need to run the <STRONG>copyfiles</STRONG> target. 
This is required to copy all the jar files from the project to JBOSS. You may have 
all the files in your JBOSS already - many of them overlap with common. 
One jar that you are likely to be missing it the commons upload. 
This is not required for the repository per se, but is required for the example web app.
</LI>
<LI>
Finally, run the <STRONG>deploy-jar</STRONG> or <STRONG>deploy-jarwar</STRONG> target
(and not both). Both targets will compile and deploy the jar file, while
the second one will also deploy the example usage war file. The jar file 
is the repository code. The war file is the example web app. The war file is 
<EM>not</EM> needed for the repository to function. If you just want to 
deploy the jar file, run <STRONG>lamscr-jar</STRONG> target and copy the 
jar file manually. When development is complete, the build file will be 
changed to deploy these files separately.
</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Demonstration Servlet</h2>
<p>To get a feel for how to use the content repository, you can run the 
demonstration servlet. Build the content repository war file (using the 
deploy jarwar ant task) and then run JBOSS. Go to the URL 
http://localhost:8080/lams_contentrepository/. </p>

<p>If you have set up the test data (using lams_common test data task)
then you can log in as atool/atool to workspace atoolworkspace. Otherwise 
create your own workspace. </p>

<p>This demonstration will allow you to upload a file (as a file node) 
or a directory (as a package node), and then view the files. You can also 
list all the files in the package. To be able to upload a directory,
the directory given must be on the server which is running JBOSS, as 
the code will do a local filesystem lookup. For example, if you 
are running on your local PC, then you can refer to any directory
on your PC. If you are running it on one of the development servers,
then the directory needs to exist on the development server, not on your
PC!</p>

<P>Make sure you put an entry in a version description when adding a file 
- this is a mandatory field and the demo will not add the file unless 
there is a version description. But the validation is broken so the
error message doesn't appear.</P>
