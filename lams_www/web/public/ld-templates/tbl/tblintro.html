<p>Your students would have gone through pre-class activities designated by you. They would form groups before completing the Individual Readiness Assessment (iRA). They would then attempt the Team Readiness Assessment (tRA), where the group leader would submit the group's answer. Next, the groups would complete a number of Application Exercises.<BR/>
As a post-class activity, your students would complete a personal reflection on the key learning points.</p>
