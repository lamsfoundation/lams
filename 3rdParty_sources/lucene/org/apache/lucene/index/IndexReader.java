/** IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing an
 index.  Search of an index is done entirely through this abstract interface,
 so that any subclass which implements it is searchable.

 <p> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
 one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link #open(String)}.

 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral--they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.

 <p> An IndexReader can be opened on a directory for which an IndexWriter is
 opened already, but it cannot be used to delete documents from the index then.

 <p>
 <b>NOTE</b>: for backwards API compatibility, several methods are not listed 
 as abstract, but have no useful implementations in this base class and 
 instead always throw UnsupportedOperationException.  Subclasses are 
 strongly encouraged to override these methods, but in many cases may not 
 need to.
 </p>

 <p>

 <b>NOTE</b>: as of 2.4, it's possible to open a read-only
 IndexReader using one of the static open methods that
 accepts the boolean readOnly parameter.  Such a reader has
 better concurrency as it's not necessary to synchronize on
 the isDeleted method.  Currently the default for readOnly
 is false, meaning if not specified you will get a
 read/write IndexReader.  But in 3.0 this default will
 change to true, meaning you must explicitly specify false
 if you want to make changes with the resulting IndexReader.
 </p>
