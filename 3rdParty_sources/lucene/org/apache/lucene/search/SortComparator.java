/**
 * Abstract base class for sorting hits returned by a Query.

 * types (SCORE, DOC, STRING, INT, FLOAT) do not provide an
 * adequate sorting.  It maintains an internal cache of values which
 * could be quite large.  The cache is an array of Comparable,
 * one for each document in the index.  There is a distinct
 * Comparable for each unique term in the field - if
 * some documents have the same term in the field, the cache
 * array will have entries which reference the same Comparable.
