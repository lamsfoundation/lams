/**
 * The Protocol class provides a set of common services for protocol layers. Each layer has to
 * be a subclass of Protocol and override a number of methods (typically just <code>up()</code>,
 * <code>down()</code> and <code>getName()</code>. Layers are stacked in a certain order to form
 * a protocol stack. <a href=org.jgroups.Event.html>Events</a> are passed from lower
 * layers to upper ones and vice versa. E.g. a Message received by the UDP layer at the bottom
 * will be passed to its higher layer as an Event. That layer will in turn pass the Event to
 * its layer and so on, until a layer handles the Message and sends a response or discards it,
 * the former resulting in another Event being passed down the stack.
 * <p/>
 * The important thing to bear in mind is that Events have to passed on between layers in FIFO
 * order which is guaranteed by the Protocol implementation and must be guranteed by subclasses
 * implementing their on Event queuing.<p>
 * <b>Note that each class implementing interface Protocol MUST provide an empty, public
 * constructor !</b>
