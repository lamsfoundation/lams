1. Required Software
====================

You will require some software to be installed and/or running for LAMS to run
properly. These are listed below

JDK 1.5 or 1.6
JBOSS-4.0.2 (Must be 4.0.2, newer and older versions have problems running LAMS)
MySql 5.0.x (Running)
Wildfire (Running - Required if you want to use chat tools)
ANT - Included in this package


2. Installation
===============

There are a few steps to installing LAMS on your computer.

Firstly make sure you have all the required software installed on your computer.
You will need to make sure that mysql is running. 

Next, you need to edit the lams.properties file (located in the root directory of
the package) to comply with the settings you want for your computer. Open the 
lams.properties file in a text editor and follow the instructions to alter the 
settings. The default settings are in the lams.properties file already so you 
need not change a lot. Pay particular attention to the Installation Options 
section and the Essential settings section.

Before you run the script, you need to ensure that your $JAVA_HOME is set to 
your java 1.5 or higher directory, also you will need to set the $PATH variable 
to include the path to the java binaries. The steps to do this are listed below.
> JAVA_HOME="(path to java installation directory)"
> export JAVA_HOME
> PATH="(path to java bin directory):$PATH"
> export PATH

Once you have finished editing lams.properties file you are ready to run the 
install script. Go to the root directory of the package and type:
> sudo ./install-lams.sh 

Follow the prompts in the install script. The installer will ask you if you wish 
to set up lams as a service, this will make lams start automatically each time
you boot your machine. The installer will attempt to detect the wrapper jar 
that is suitable for you, if it cannot you can choose the wrapper that is the 
closest to suiting your architecture, or follow the instructions at: 
wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lamsdocs/Setup+Java+Service+Wrapper+for+LAMS
to set up the wrapper manually.

You can find out your architecture types by typing
> uname -a	to get all the inforamtion 
> uname -m	to get the architecture type

wrapper-linux-ppc-64-3.2.3	Linux	PPC
wrapper-linux-x86-32-3.2.3	Linux	i386 	
wrapper-linux-x86-64-3.2.3	Linix	IA64 	


3. Languages and Locales
========================

In LAMS 2.0 you can set the defualt language of your server to be one of many
languages, and more to come, see http://lamscommunity.org

Look out for unix language packs to add to your list of language locales

The locale options for LAMS-2.0 available are listed below, simply put in
your lams.properties file (under Installation Options):

LOCALE - (locale)
LOCALE_DIRECTION - (locale direction)

Language		Locale	Locale-Direction
------------------------------------------------
English	(Australia)		en_AU	LTR
Español	(Spanish)		es_ES	LTR
Deutsch	(German)		de_DE	LTR
简体中文 (Chinese Simplified)	zh_CN	LTR

Norsk (Norwegian)		no_NO	LTR
Svenska	(Swedish)		sv_SE	LTR

Ελληνικά (Greek)		el_GR	LTR


4. Production Server Configuration
============================

For single user installations, (i.e. personal use on your desktop), please
ignore this section - LAMS should run fine using the default settings.

You may need to increase the limit for database connections, this can be
done at (jboss directory)/server/default/deploy/mysql-ds.xml. Set the
max-pool-size option to what you want, but it must be less than or equal to
the max connections in mysql-Xms

If your server starts reporting out of memory errors in the JBoss server.log
file, you may need to increase the JVM memory settings for your server.
This can be altered in the (jboss directory)/bin/run-lams.sh script.

More information can be found at:
http://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lamsdocs/Production+Server+Settings 


5. Startup and Shutdown
=======================

To start LAMS 2.0 go to (jboss directory)/bin and type:
>sudo ./run-lams.sh 

After a couple of minutes LAMS 2.0 will have started. In your browser type the 
server URL that you specified in the lams.configuration file, and you should be 
at the lams homepage.

To shutdown LAMS 2.0 go to (jboss directory)/bin and type;
> sudo ./shutdown.sh -S

LAMS 2.0 will take a few moments to shut down. To check if LAMS 2.0 has shut 
down correctly, type the following on Linux:
> ps -ef | grep java

Or type the following on Macintosh
> ps -A | grep Java

If you aren't sure which version of 'ps' to use, try the '-ef' version and if
that gives and error 'ps: illegal option --f" then try the -A version.


If you can see the LAMS 2.0 process still running, type:
> sudo kill (pid) 
Where pid is the process id listed next to the LAMS 2.0 process

Be careful to type the correct (pid). If you type the wrong number, you will 
stop another process on your server, and as you are using sudo you could stop 
an important process!

6. Using the Java Service Wrapper
================================

If the wrapper installed correctly, LAMS will start automatically when you 
boot your machine and stop when you turn off your machine.

You can also start and stop LAMS manually by going to the jboss-4.0.2/bin 
directory and using these commands.

> sudo ./lams2 start	(starts LAMS)
> sudo ./lams2 console	(start LAMS in current shell, to stop do ctrl+C)
> sudo ./lams2 stop 	(stops LAMS)
> sudo ./lams2 restart	(restarts LAMS)
> sudo ./lams2 status	(tells you if LAMS is currently running)
> sudo ./lams2 dump 	(send a kill -3 signal to the wrapper causing the 
			JVM to do a full thread dump)

For more information about using the Jave Service Wrapper with LAMS, go to
wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lamsdocs/Setup+Java+Service+Wrapper+for+LAMS

7. Backing up LAMS
================== 

To backup your LAMS installation manually, simply follow the following steps

1) Backup your jboss-4.0.2 directory where LAMS is installed
(/usr/local/jboss-4.0.2 by default)

2) Backup your uploaded file repositories
(/var/opt/lams by default)

3) Backup /etc/lams2

4) Dump the database by executing the following command. Fill in your own 
backup directory

<sqldir>/mysqldump -u<dbuser> -p<dbpassword> <dbname> > <backupdir>/lams.dump
